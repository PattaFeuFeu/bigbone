# BigBone Support

This document provides information on how to get support for BigBone from a library user perspective. If you are a contributor
to the project, please check out our [Code Contribution Guidelines](CONTRIBUTING.md).

## Support Channels

You can communicate with us through different ways. We prefer open communication and therefore deliberately avoid email support. 
We value transparency and traceability. For this reason, we limit ourselves to the channels below.

### GitHub Issues

If you have found a bug or want to submit a request for a new feature, please [open an issue](https://github.com/andregasser/bigbone/issues).
Please make sure that you create an accurate problem description that allows us to reproduce the issue.

### GitHub Discussions

If you have a question about using BigBone or other topics that are not necessarily considered issues, please [open a discussion thread](https://github.com/andregasser/bigbone/discussions). 
We will try to help you as good as possible. If necessary, we can open an issue for this after, if needed.

## Managing Expectations

BigBone is developed and maintained by volunteers in their spare time. Therefore, we cannot guarantee response times or 
the like. We do not offer professional support for this library. Support is always best effort and sometimes it can take 
longer because nobody has time. This is just how it is. Thank you for your understanding.
