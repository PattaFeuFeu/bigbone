# Contributing to BigBone

We want to make contributing to this project as easy and transparent as possible, whether it's:

- Reporting a bug
- Discussing the current state of the code
- Submitting a fix
- Proposing new features
- Becoming a maintainer

## We Develop with GitHub
We use GitHub to host code, to track issues and feature requests, as well as accept pull requests.

## Reporting a bug
We use GitHub issues to track public bugs. Report a bug by [opening a new issue](https://github.com/andregasser/bigbone/issues); it's that easy!

**Great bug reports** tend to have:

- A quick summary and/or background
- Steps to reproduce
  - Be specific!
  - Give sample code if you can. 
- What you expected would happen
- What actually happens
- Notes (possibly including why you think this might be happening, or stuff you tried that didn't work)

## Propose code changes
Pull requests are the best way to propose changes to the codebase. We actively welcome your pull requests:

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `master`.
2. If you've added code that should be tested, add tests.
3. If you've changed APIs, update the documentation.
4. Ensure the test suite passes and code is properly formatted - use `gradlew check` for this.
5. Create that pull request!

Any contributions you make will be under the MIT Software License. Feel free to contact the maintainers if that's a concern.
