**BigBone** is a [Mastodon](https://docs.joinmastodon.org/) client library for Java and Kotlin.

# Why BigBone

BigBone is a fork of [Mastodon4J](https://github.com/sys1yagi/mastodon4j), a Mastodon client library for Java and Kotlin that was published by Toshihiro Yagi. 
The goal of Mastodon4J at that time was to provide an easy-to-use library for interacting with the Mastodon social media network from Java and Kotlin code. 
Unfortunately, it became abandoned and has not seen any updates since 2018. 

Since Elon Musk's Twitter acquisition in 2022, Mastodon has gained tremendous popularity. A project that is so well received by the community deserves to have 
up-to-date client libraries. I have therefore decided to jump in and am now maintaining the BigBone client library since mid-November 2022 as an alternative 
to Mastodon4J. I hope that this library will help other developers to build cool stuff for the Mastodon community.

The name **BigBone** has mostly symbolic character. I have chosen the name BigBone for this library because Mastodons represent impressive animals from the 
Pleistocene, built of big and heavy bones. At the same time, we hope this library will build some sort of "skeleton" for your Mastodon-related projects. 
Interestingly, there is also [Big Bone Lick State Park in Kentucky](https://parks.ky.gov/union/parks/historic/big-bone-lick-state-historic-site) where 
American Mastodons have been excavated.

# Core Functionality

With a library like BigBone, you can build tools which
- act on status updates on any of your timelines (home, local, federated)
- post, reblog, and favourite statuses
- plus lots of other stuff!

# Implementation Status

BigBone does not yet implement the full API of Mastodon. Actually, there is still **a lot to do**. The main focus for future releases will be extending the 
API coverage and fixing bugs that pop up. For some more insights please check out any of these pages:

- [Mastodon API Coverage](https://github.com/andregasser/bigbone/wiki/Mastodon-API-Coverage) 
- [Release Roadmap](https://github.com/andregasser/bigbone/wiki/Release-Roadmap)

BigBone uses [Semantic Versioning 2.0.0](http://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

# Previous Work

My personal thanks go to Toshihiro and his contributors back then for building [Mastodon4J](https://github.com/sys1yagi/mastodon4j). The library they have
built in the past serves as a basis for our own development efforts. ‚ù§Ô∏è Thank you! ‚ù§Ô∏è
