# Security Policy

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you believe you've identified a security vulnerability in BigBone (a bug that allows something to happen that shouldn't be possible), please
[open a BigBone security issue](https://github.com/andregasser/bigbone/security/advisories/new).

You should not report such issues on public GitHub issues or in other public spaces to give us time to publish a fix for the issue without exposing BigBone's users to increased risk.
